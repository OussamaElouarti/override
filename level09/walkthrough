In this level the program calls handle_msg function, which passes the same argument onto both functions, set_username and set_message.

in set_username the program reads 0x80 bytes from the input and copies the first 41 bytes of the input onto (parameter + 0x8c)

the second function set_msg reads 0x400 bytes from the input then copies (int)*(parameter + 0xb4) bytes onto (parameter)

the distance between the local in handle_msg stack frame and the location of the return address is 200, this means the second copy should be greater than 204.

Luckily the copy size is relative to our first input.

There is a function called secret_backdoor which reads from the input the argument for system.

payload will be:
python -c "print 40*'a'+'\xff'+'\n'+200*'a'+'\x8c\x48\x55\x55\x55\x55\x00\x00'"
